# Todoist Workflow for Alfred <img src="https://www.alfredapp.com/media/logo4@2x.png" alt="alfred-icon" width="30"/>
This workflow is inspired by Jeff Su's [Simple Productivity System (for normal people)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M6bIeVbCqA) and focuses on the concept of Creating/Organizing. The idea behind this approach is to encourage continuous creation of ideas or tasks as they come up, without worrying about organizing them immediately. Instead, you can capture and store these ideas in a designated place, allowing you to organize and categorize them at a later time. This workflow promotes a more fluid and flexible approach to productivity, enabling you to maintain a steady flow of creativity while ensuring that nothing gets lost or forgotten.
