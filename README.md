# Todoist Workflow for Alfred <img src="https://www.alfredapp.com/media/logo4@2x.png" alt="alfred-icon" width="30"/>
Inspired by Jeff Su's [Simple Productivity System (for normal people)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M6bIeVbCqA) which introduces the concept of Creating/Organizing. This workflow allows you to keep on creating as ideas/tasks come up, so you can organize it to the correct place later.
